        <p>Hey, I am Vaibhav, 20 years old. I am passionate about programming. Unfortunately I got into
            programming late that is when I was 19. </p>

        <br>

        <p>I am focusing my programming studies mostly on web dev. front end technologies. I also have some experience
            in Android dev. using Java language.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>As of now I have good experience in HTML and CSS. Currently I am learning CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. 
            I have also studied basics of Javascript but did not build a project with it. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>You can find the projects that I build on the main page of this website</p>
